# LeafGuard-AI
This project is a deep learning-powered web application that helps identify plant leaf diseases from images. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with TensorFlow/Keras, the system classifies leaves into multiple categories (healthy or diseased) and provides information about the cause and suggested cure.
